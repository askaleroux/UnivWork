As a programming language, C is rather like Pascal or Fortran. Values are stored
in variables. Programs are structured by defining and calling functions. Program
flow  is  controlled  using  loops,  if statements and function calls. Input and
output  can  be directed to the terminal or to files. Related data can be stored
together in arrays or structures.

Of the three languages, C allows the most precise control of input and output. C
is  also  rather  more  terse  than  Fortran or Pascal. This can result in short
efficient  programs,  where  the  programmer  has  made wise use of C's range of
powerful  operators. It also allows the programmer to produce programs which are
impossible to understand.

Programmers  who  are familiar with the use of pointers (or indirect addressing,
to  use  the correct term) will welcome the ease of use compared with some other
languages.  Undisciplined use of pointers can lead to errors which are very hard
to trace. This course only deals with the simplest applications of pointers.

It is hoped that newcomers will find C a useful and friendly language. Care must
be  taken  in  using C. Many of the extra facilities which it offers can lead to
extra  types  of programming error. You will have to learn to deal with these to
successfully  make  the  transition  to  being  a  C  programmer.
